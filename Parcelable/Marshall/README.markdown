This sample Android app demonstrates
avoiding problems with custom `Parcelable` classes when using them in extras of an `Intent` wrapped in a `PendingIntent` (e.g., for a `Notification`).

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on `Parcelable`](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/writing-and-using-parcelables)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
