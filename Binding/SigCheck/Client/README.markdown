This sample Android app demonstrates
the client side of a pair of apps that communicate using remote services and AIDL, where the client validates the signing key of the service implementation to ensure that it is the desired app (and not some repackaged malware).

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on remote services](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/remote-services-and-the-binding-pattern)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
