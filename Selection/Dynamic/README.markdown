This sample Android app demonstrates
implementing a `ListView` with row contents populated by `getView()` of an `ArrayAdapter`.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on `AdapterView` and `Adapter`](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/adapterviews-and-adapters)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
