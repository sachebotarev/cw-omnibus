This sample Android app demonstrates
integrating [the Application Crash reports Android (ACRA) library](http://www.acra.ch/)
for finding out about when your app crashes on users' devices.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on ACRA](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/crash-reporting-using-acra)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
