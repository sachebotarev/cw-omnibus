This sample Android app demonstrates
using `android:layout_weight` in a `LinearLayout` to allocate space on a percentage basis.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on `LinearLayout`](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/linearlayout-and-the-box-model)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
