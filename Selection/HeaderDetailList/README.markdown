This sample Android app demonstrates
implementing a `ListView` with a mix of header and detail rows, each with their own layout.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on advanced `ListView` techniques](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/advanced-listviews)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
