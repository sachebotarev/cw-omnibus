This sample Android app demonstrates
offering drag-and-drop with popup actions, akin to how some home screens display an "uninstall" option when you try dragging an icon from the launcher.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on drag-and-drop](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/drag-and-drop)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
