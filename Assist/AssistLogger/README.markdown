This sample Android app demonstrates
implementing the Assist API, in this case in the form of an "assistant" that logs all the data that is available to assistants in general through this API.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on the Assist API](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/the-assist-api-now-on-tap)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
