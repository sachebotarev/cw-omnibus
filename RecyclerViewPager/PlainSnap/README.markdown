This sample Android app demonstrates
using a `RecyclerView` and a `LinearSnapHelper` as a replacement for `ViewPager`.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on advanced `RecyclerView` techniques](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/advanced-recyclerview)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
