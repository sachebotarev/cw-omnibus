This sample Android app demonstrates
a `Notification` that uses a custom view instead of a standard `Notification` style.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on advanced notifications](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/advanced-notifications)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
