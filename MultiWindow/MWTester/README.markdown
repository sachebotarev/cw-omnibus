an app that starts the activities from the companion `MWSampler` app, both normally and in separate tasks, to see the difference in behavior.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on multi-window support](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/multi-window-support)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
