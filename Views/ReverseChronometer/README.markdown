This sample Android app demonstrates
implementing a custom `View`, in the form of a countdown variation of a `Chronometer`.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on custom views](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/crafting-your-own-views)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
