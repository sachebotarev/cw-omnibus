This sample Android app demonstrates
having a `debug`-build-only diagnostic overlay in an application (akin to the red flash you can enabled for `StrictMode` violations).

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on in-app diagnostics](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/in-app-diagnostics)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
