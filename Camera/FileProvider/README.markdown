This sample Android app demonstrates
using `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE`, using a `FileProvider` and a `content:` `Uri` for `EXTRA_OUTPUT`.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on working with third-party camera code](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/using-the-camera-via-3rd-party-apps)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
