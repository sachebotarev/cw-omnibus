This sample Android app demonstrates
how a `ViewPager` can be used in a fragment and also have fragments as pages.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on advanced `ViewPager` techniques](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/more-fun-with-pagers)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
